This Repository holds everything in my ~/.vim folder.

I've migrated over to using Plug to manage vim plugins and coc-nvim to provide intellisense via Language Servers using LSP. To use them, however, I've had to use vim >= 8.1 which required me to build it from source.

for coc.nvim:

 Install base set of coc.nvim plugins with the install_coc_extensions.sh extensitons included:
    (found from https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Acoc.nvim&page=1&perPage=20)
    coc-python
    coc-phpls
    coc-html
    coc-json
    coc-gitignore
    coc-java
    coc-xml
    coc-sh
    coc-elixir
    coc-prettier
    coc-tsserver
    coc-snippet

    Note: ** check extestion status with 


 coc-settings.json is configured to allow the following external language servers:
    
    Elm(https://github.com/elm-tooling/elm-language-server):
        // pre-req
        npm install -g elm elm-test elm-format
        // install language server
        npm install -g @elm-tooling/elm-language-server

    Scala
        //needs metals 
        // see Not yet supporting Scala 2.12.9 for all features: see https://github.com/scalameta/metals/issues/856



    





Pre-migration setup:

// Generally, I use The Pathogen plugin to manage my plugins, and I strongly reccomend you switch to using it too.
// 
// The update_bundles script was written by Tammer Saleh, and published by him in his blog post which talks about why we should switch to Pathogen plugin for vim:
// 
// http://tammersaleh.com/posts/the-modern-vim-config-with-pathogen
// 
// His update_bundles script will remove plugins from the bundle folder, then grab the most updated version from their respective git repositories. You can modify that script to include/exclude your vim plugins which reside in ./bundle

//no longer using scala... so ignore the following block
//I have added scala support for exuberant-ctags by adding a .ctag file containing regex expressions found on 
//
//http://latestbuild.net/scala-ctags-and-vim-tagbar
//
//to add scala support to ctags, copy the .ctags file to ~/.ctags. 
//
//update_external_configs.sh will copy files such as .vimrc and .tags to their locations outside this folder. Be carefull that you don't overide your own settings.

// In the .vimrc, "set tags=/usr/local/src/tags" loads the tags which I made from various source code kept in /usr/local/src. The 'tags' file is made using exuberant-ctags:
// 
//     cd /usr/local/src/
//     tags -R *
// 
// you can adjust this to suite your own source code locations. 
// 
// I've started using neocomplete for elm development, but that requires vim to be compiled with lua. To install vim that is compiled with lua and other goodies, see https://gist.github.com/neildaemond/1fb83611a84c4ea19ec1fd462e47d081
// 
// Otherwise, you'll have to comment out the neocomplete related items in .vimrc
