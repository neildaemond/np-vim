This Repository holds everything in my ~/.vim folder. My work with vim is documented on my website at:

Generally, I use The Pathogen plugin to manage my plugins, and I strongly reccomend you switch to using it too.

The update_bundles script was written by Tammer Saleh, and published by him in his blog post which talks about why we should switch to Pathogen plugin for vim. The update_bundles script will update the vim pugins from their respective git repositories. You can modify that script to include/exclude your vim plugins which reside in ./bundle

I have added scala support for exuberant-ctags by adding a .ctag file containing regex expressions found on 

http://latestbuild.net/scala-ctags-and-vim-tagbar

to add scala support to ctags, copy the .ctags file to ~/.ctags
