This Repository holds everything in my ~/.vim folder. My work with vim is documented on my website at:

Generally, I use The Pathogen plugin to manage my plugins, and I strongly reccomend you switch to using it too.

The update_bundles script was written by Tammer Saleh, and published by him in his blog post which talks about why we should switch to Pathogen plugin for vim:

His update_bundles script will remove plugins from the bundle folder, then grab the most updated version from their respective git repositories. You can modify that script to include/exclude your vim plugins which reside in ./bundle

I have added scala support for exuberant-ctags by adding a .ctag file containing regex expressions found on 

http://latestbuild.net/scala-ctags-and-vim-tagbar

to add scala support to ctags, copy the .ctags file to ~/.ctags. 

update_external_configs.sh will copy files such as .vimrc and .tags to their locations outside this folder. Be carefull that you don't overide your own settings.

In the .vimrc, "set tags=/usr/share/scala/tags" loads the which I made from scala source. I made this by downloading the scala source files to /usr/share/scala/scala-source, then using exuberant-ctags, I did:

    cd /usr/share/scala
    tags -R *

you can adjust this to suite your own scala locations.
